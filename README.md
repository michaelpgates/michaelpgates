##### Michael Gates

I am an enthusiastic, hardworking individual looking to break into the cybersecurity field. I have been a lifelong computer enthusiast having worked on a range of computers from the commodore 64 to custom built gaming PCs. As a USAF veteran, I have 6 years of military experience as an aircraft mechanic and I am currently an associate at an Amazon sortation center. At this point in my life I am beyond focused and disciplined. I am actively and relentlessly improving my skills and exposure in the cybersecurity and programming field with the desire to make a meaningful impact.
